	1. Plot
	I was looking for the video, when our 1 year old imitates the sound of a bee. I knew where I took the video, but the video was lost among the other hunderds. I tried but I could not locate it easily. 
	
	2. Introduction
	I liked Google Photos a lot, when it was a service for infinite number of images and videos. That era is gone and I stopped using Google Photos. I have my photos organized into descriptive folders anyway, but I had one good feature missing: 
	When you moved the mouse over a video, it let you peek in. So when you were looking for a video, it was much easier to find than having only the firs frame displayed.

I wondered, if I could get done something similar with creating the images into webpages, where images are displayed as thumbnails and videos like gifs.
